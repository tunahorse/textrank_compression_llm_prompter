TextRank Summary:

The first step is to decide what to work on.
The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.
In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion.
Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.
So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.
[1]

That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult.
When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like.
Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet.
So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.
The way to figure out what to work on is by working.
If you're not sure what to work on, guess.
But pick something and get going.
You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine.
It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.
Develop a habit of working on your own projects.
Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do.
If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.
It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it.
What should your projects be?
Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious.
As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge.
At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics.
But always preserve excitingness.
There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work.
It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.
What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people?
That's what you're looking for.
Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge.
Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.
The next step is to notice them.
This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world.
Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted.
[2]

If the answers seem strange, so much the better.
Great work often has a tincture of strangeness.
You see this from painting to math.
It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it.
Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren't.
If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find.
[3]

Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones.
This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.
Steps two and four will require hard work.
It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.
That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in.
Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.
The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive.
Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.
The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud.
You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world inside.
Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on.
The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them.
Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it.
And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work.
So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information.
[4]

The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem.
Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it.
Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.
The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy.
They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like.
And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.
It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow magically guess as a teenager.
They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own.
Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.
What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on?
What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself.
You need to take action.
But there is no systematic procedure you can follow.
When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved.
They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.
So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious.
Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.
[5]

When in doubt, optimize for interestingness.
Fields change as you learn more about them.
What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes.
So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like.
But a field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it.
If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.
Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people.
The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better.
Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive.
And you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before.
One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.
But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty.
If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch.
If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want.
The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want.
Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use.
Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.
This should follow from the excitingness rule.
Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read.
The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.
Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants.
And once you go down that route, you're lost.

There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on.
Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds.
But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them.
If you're interested, you're not astray.
Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles.
You usually have to risk rejection and failure.
So it does take a good deal of boldness.
But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning.
In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it.
Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.
The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance.
You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way.
I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much.
At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future.
I call this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.
Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward.
There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work.
But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't like that.
You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.
There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals.
So there's a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.
For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too hard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.
The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type.
Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.
Ideally those hours will be contiguous.
To the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.
You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.
It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.
You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold.
Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character.
Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project.
And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.
It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't.
When I'm reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by saying "I'll just read over what I've got so far." Five minutes later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I'm off.
Similar techniques work for starting new projects.
It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.
Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it be?"

This is one case where the young have an advantage.
They're more optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.
Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected.
Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline.
In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.
Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on, at least in your own mind.
If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all.
